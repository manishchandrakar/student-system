# Studennt-System

This React-powered project offers two courses: 'Introduction to React Native' with John Doe and 'Web Development Fundamentals' with Jane Smith. The React Native course is open for enrollment and delves into mobile app development basics, while the Web Development Fundamentals course, also built with React, is currently closed and focuses on HTML and CSS. Enrolled React-loving students include Alice, Bob, Charlie, and David.
